Greetings, fellow tech enthusiasts and security adventurers! This blog chronicles my journey into the cryptic world of malware analysis and reverse engineering. Buckle up, because I'm starting as a (maybe not so) complete n00b, determined to navigate the complexities of this domain.

In our inaugural post, we dive straight into the action with a focus on challenges from TryHackMe's Basic Malware RE (Reverse Engineering). Join us as we navigate through real-world scenarios, dissecting malware samples, and uncovering the tactics used by cybercriminals to evade detection and wreak havoc (that's what they do, right?).

Consider this a real-time learning experience, where I'll be sharing my struggles, breakthroughs, and hopefully, some valuable insights along the way. Resources, technical breakdowns, and the occasional head-scratching moment - you'll find it all here.

# Strings :: Challenge 1:

Alright folks, let's dive into the first challenge of TryHackMe's Basic Malware RE course!


## Step 1: 

Initially, I went down the route of using a tool called PEStudio to extract all the strings from the provided binary. This seemed like a straightforward approach, but PEStudio picked up a lot of "false flags" prepared to distract any approaching analyst. This was a real rabbit hole, sending you down paths that ultimately lead nowhere.

## Step 2:

Realizing this, I switched gears and fired up Ghidra (while loving NSA as much as I love taxes). Navigating through the code, I have easly identified the program's **entry point**. Following the execution flow from the entry point led me to the actual flag referenced on the screen:

# Strings :: Challenge 2:

## Step 1:

## Step n: 

Simple Python script to concatenate values into flag (this is not production-ready enterprise code, as You see).
```python
with open('strings2.txt', 'r') as stringsFile:
    for line in stringsFile:
        print(line.strip()[-2], end = '')
```
