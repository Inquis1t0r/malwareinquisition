In this blog posts series, I'll be delving into the practical exercises provided in the renowned book "Practical Malware Analysis," offering insights, strategies, and hands-on experiences to fortify my understanding of malware behavior and analysis techniques. 

I will also try out more modern tools and prepare things like Yara rules and more extensive reportes whenever possible, in order to use every opportunity to sharpen all those essential and additional skills.

# Chapter 1 
## Lab 1-1: 
TODO" File hashes
### Question 1: Upload the files to http://www.VirusTotal.com/ and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?


Lab01-01.exe
![pma](/assets/images/Lab01-01exe.png)

Lab01-01.dll
![pma](/assets/images/Lab01-01dll.png)


### Question 2: When were these files compiled?

Lab01-01.exe

Sun Dec 19 16:16:19 2010 | UTC

Lab01-01.dll

Sun Dec 19 16:16:38 2010 | UTC

### Question 3: Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators?
<!--TODO: Note on PE Entropy-->
Lab01-01.exe

![entropy1-1exe](/assets/images/Entropy1-1exe.png)
![bintext1-1exe](/assets/images/bintext1-1exe.png)

Lab01-01.dll

![entropy1-1dll](/assets/images/Entropy1-1dll.png)
![bintext1-1dll](/assets/images/bintext1-1dll.png)


For both samples calculated entropy is in the mid range, PEiD didn't detect any packer used, but was able to detect most likely used compiler. BinText we are able to see readable strings. So there are no indicators that those binaries were packed.

### Question 4: Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?

For Lab01-01.exe there are a couple of imports that attract attention:<br>
-KERNEL32.dll<br>
&emsp;→ CopyFileA/CreateFileA/CreateFileMappingA<br>
&emsp;→ FindClose/FindFirstFileA/FindNextFileA<br>
&emsp;→ IsBadReadPtr<br>
&emsp;→ MapViewOfFile/UnmapViewOfFile<br>

Potentialy the binary creates some files. Potential dropper (?) 

Lab01-01.dll:<br>
-KERNEL32.dll<br>
&emsp;→ CreateProcessA<br>
&emsp;→ Sleep<br>

Most likely this dll spawns a new process, and some of its actions are delayed (maybe to make malware less likely to be noticed by the user? Or to synchronize its activity with some events/resource availability?).


### Question 5: Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?
In String of Lab01-01.exe we can find reference to file kerne132.exe (with "one" instead of L) in location C:\windows\system32\.

For Lab01-01.dll there is no indicators. 

### Question 6: What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines?

Lab01-01.exe doesn't contain any obvious network related indicators. 

Lab01-01.dll references ip address of 127.26.152.13.

### Question 7: What would you guess is the purpose of these files?

RAT/backdoor disguised as a system file (?), with persistance implemented. 
 
## Lab 1-2:

Hashes:


### Question 1: Upload the Lab01-02.exe file to VirusTotal. Does it match any existing antivirus definitions? 


This sample is old, so nothing suprising there.

### Question 2: Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.

With PEiD we can quickly find that it detects that UPX packer was used and entry point -> UPX1.

![01-02PEiD](/assets/images/Lab01-02PEiD.jpg)

We get same recult with Detect It Easy:
![01-02DIE](/assets/images/Lab01-02DIE.png)

String extraction also confirms that UPX was used:
![01-02Strings](/assets/images/Lab01-02Strings.png)

### Question 3: Do any imports hint at this program’s functionality? If so, which imports are they and what do they tell you?

### Question 4: What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?

Host based:
I was unable to find any indicators with Strings exctraction alone. Further dynamic analysis is required. 

Network  based:
There is a reference to URL: hxxp[://]www[.]malwareanalysisbook[.]com/ that might potentialy be used for C2 connection. 

## Lab 1-3:

### Question 1: Upload the Lab01-03.exe file to VirusTotal. Does it match any existing antivirus definitions? 

### Question 2: Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.

### Question 3: Do any imports hint at this program’s functionality? If so, which imports are they and what do they tell you?

### Question 4: What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?

## Lab 1-4:
